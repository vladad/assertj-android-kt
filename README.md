AssertJ Android KT
==================

A set of AssertJ assertions geared toward testing Android.

This library is clone of great library [assertj-android](https://github.com/square/assertj-android) with theese modifications:

 *  Is written in Kotlin
 *  Has AndroidX dependency instead of Android Support Library. So no Jetifier is needed.
 *  It does not contain all asserts from original library, but only small subset which I needed in other project.
